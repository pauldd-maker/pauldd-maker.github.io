    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is <strong>Cameron Paul Seguisabal</strong>, and I’m from the Philippines. 
      I’m a student who enjoys learning about computers, technology, and design. 
      I believe that every small step in learning helps me grow into a better version of myself.
    </p>

    <h2>My School Life</h2>
    <p>
      I’m currently studying in the field of <strong>Information Technology (IT)</strong>. 
      In school, I learn about programming, computer systems, and how technology shapes our daily lives. 
      I enjoy working on projects, coding, and exploring new software that helps improve how we learn and communicate.
    </p>
    <p>
      School has taught me discipline, teamwork, and problem-solving. 
      My teachers and classmates inspire me to keep improving and to always stay curious about technology.
    </p>

    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <p>
      Outside of class, I like to spend time learning new things about coding and game design — especially creating Roblox scripts and simple websites. 
      I also enjoy playing games, exploring creative ideas, and hanging out with friends.
    </p>

    <h2>Future Goals</h2>
    <p>
      My goal is to become a skilled IT professional or developer. 
      I want to create projects that can make people’s lives easier and inspire others to pursue technology as well. 
      I believe that with passion and hard work, anything is possible.
    </p>
